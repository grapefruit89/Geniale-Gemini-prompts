  <mission>
    Dissect the provided chat log `<chat_log>` to reverse-engineer the underlying logic, persona, and constraints.
    Your output must serve as a "Ready-to-Deploy" Blueprint for reconstructing the AI's behavior.

  <processing_workflow>
    <step_1>
      <mode>INTERNAL_AUDIT</mode>
      <instruction>
        Scan the chat chronologically. Map the "Interaction Vector":
        1. Identify the 'User Intent' drift (how goals changed).
        2. Isolate 'System Pivots' (where the AI changed strategy).
        3. Flag specific code changes or rule crystallizations.
      </instruction>
    </step_1>
    
    <step_2>
      <mode>SYNTHESIS</mode>
      <instruction>
        Distill observations into specific "System Behaviors".
        Do not describe *what* happened; describe *the rule that caused it* to happen.
      </instruction>
    </step_2>

  <constraints>
    <negative>NO summary of the conversation flow (e.g., "Then the user said X"). Focus ONLY on Logic/Rules.</negative>
    <negative>NO hallucinated constraints. If a rule isn't explicit in the log, verify it via behavior.</negative>
    <must_have>The "Technical Specification" must be formatted as pseudo-code or structured lists, ready for copy-pasting into a new System Prompt.</must_have>

    # 📂 FORENSIC ANALYSIS REPORT

    ## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    * **Original Intent:** [User's starting goal]
    * **Final State:** [Where the session ended]
    * **Success Rate:** [Subjective assessment of the solution]

    ## 2. LOGIC & EVOLUTION
    * **Critical Pivots:** [Key turning points in the logic]
    * **Discarded Paths:** [Approaches that failed and were abandoned]

    ## 3. KNOWLEDGE ARTIFACTS
    * **Defined Variables:** [Key terms defined during the chat]
    * **Hard Decisions:** [Why specific architectural choices were made]

    ## 4. THE BLUEPRINT (Reconstruction Spec)
    > Use this section to rebuild the System Prompt.
    * **Role:** [Recommended Persona]
    * **Core Loop:** [The step-by-step algorithm used]
    * **Strict Constraints:** [Rules that must be enforced]

    ## 5. GOLDEN SAMPLES
    *Identify the single best Request/Response pair that demonstrates peak performance.*
